		PROFILE OUTPUT PROCESSING TOOLS FOR R
                =====================================


This package provides some simple tools for examining Rprof output
and, in particular, extracting and viewing call graph information.
Call graph information, including which direct calls where observed
and how much time was spent in these calls, can be very useful in
identifying performance bottlenecks.

One important caution: because of lazy evaluation a nested call
f(g(x)) will appear on the profile call stack as if g had been called
by f or one of f's callees, because it is the point at which the value
of g(x) is first needed that triggers the evaluation.


EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

The package exports five functions:

    readProfileData reads the data in the file produced by Rprof into a
        data structure used by the other functions in the package.
        The format of the data structure is subject to change.

    flatProfile is similar to summaryRprof.  It returns either a
        matrix with output analogous to gprof's flat profile or a
        matrix like the by.total component returned by summaryRprof;
        which is returned depends on the value of an optional second
        argument.

    printProfileCallGraph produces a printed representation of the
        call graph.  It is analogous to the call graph produced by
        gprof with a few minor changes.  Reading the gprof manual
        section on the call graph should help understanding this
        output.  The output is similar enough to gprof output for the
        cgprof (http://mvertes.free.fr/) script to be able to produce
        a call graph via Graphviz.

    profileCallGraph2Dot prints out a Graphviz .dot file representing
        the profile graph.  Times spent in calls can be mapped to node
        and edge colors.  The resulting files can then be viewed with
        the Graphviz command line tools.

    plotProfileCallGraph uses the graph and Rgraphviz packages to
        produce call graph visualizations within R.  You will need to
        install these packages to use this function.


EXPORTED VARIABLES

The package also exports two variables:

    plain.style
    google.style

These are style specifications to be used with the call graph display
functions plotProfileCallGraph and profileCallGraph2Dot.


A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

Collect profile information  for the examples for glm:

          Rprof("glm.out")
          example(glm)
          Rprof()
          pd <- readProfileData("glm.out")

Obtain flat profile information:

          flatProfile(pd)
          flatProfile(pd, FALSE)

Obtain a printed call graph on the standard output:

          printProfileCallGraph(pd)

If you have the cgprof script and the Graphviz command line tools
available on a UNIX-like system, then you can save the printed graph
to a file,

          printProfileCallGraph(pd, "glm.graph")

and either use

          cgprof -TX glm.graph

to display the graph in the interactive graph viewer dotty, or use

          cgprof -Tps glm.graph > glm.ps
          gv glm.ps

to create a PostScript version of the call graph and display it with
gv.

Instead of using the printed graph and cgprof you can create a
Graphviz .dot file representation of the call graph with

          profileCallGraph2Dot(pd, filename = "glm.dot", score = "total")

and view the graph interactively with dotty using

          dotty glm.dot

or as a postscript file with

          dot -Tps glm.dot > glm.ps
          gv glm.ps

Finally, if you have the packages graph and Rgraphviz from
Bioconductor installed, then you can view the call graph within R
using

          plotProfileCallGraph(pd, score = "total")

Both plotProfileCallGraph and profileCallGraph2Dot accept many
parameters for adjusting features of the display. You can specify
these parameters individually or with a single style parameter.
For example,

          plotProfileCallGraph(pd, style = google.style)

displayes the call graph in a style similar to the one used by the
pprof tool in the Google Performance Tools suite.


OPEN ISSUES

My intention was to handle cycles roughly the same way that gprof
does.  I am not completely sure that I have managed to do this; I am
also not completely sure this is the best approach.

The graphs produced by cgprof and by plotProfileGraph and friends when
mergeEdges is false differ a bit.  I think this is due to the
heuristics of cgprof not handling cycle entries ideally and that the
plotProfileGraph graphs are actually closer to what is wanted.  When
mergeEdges is true the resulting graphs are DAGs, which simplifies
interpretation, but at the cost of lumping all cycle members together.

gprof provides options for pruning graph printouts by omitting
specified nodes.  It may be useful to allow this here as well.
